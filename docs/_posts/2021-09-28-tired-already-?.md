<sub>It's been said that People learn from their mistakes.

<sub>Is it true ¯\_( ͡❛ ͜ʖ ͡❛)_/¯ ?
Well I have done a hell lot of mistakes in my life and one of them was not realizing the power of "***CODING***" earlier.

<sub>When I was in college, I was like any other person who eat, sleep, ~~rave~~ netflix <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28886101/135523817-4bd1041a-17d5-4759-bbd2-767d1a552009.jpg" width="20"> & repeat. 
But I was not aware that this may turn myself into a person who does not like to work or study or learn new things.
A person who is lazy and ir-responsible. A person with no aim. Direction-less. ¯\_( ͡👁️ ͜ʖ ͡👁️)_/¯

<sub>When my friends were getting married or getting a new job I was frustating on myself seeing their status & posts on <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28886101/135524061-01516e19-5613-496a-8019-aaa8004ef510.png" width="10">acebook.
At one point of time I even de-activated my Fb account because let's agree we all went through that phase when everyone else is happy and you are not because you are suffering from  "*DUSRO KI KHUSHI.COM PROBLEM*"【 ❛︠ ෴ ︡❛】 .

<sub>You are being shamed for that "*Sharma Ji ka Ladka and ladki*" in your colony who got the job and got married as well.

<sub>And a few days later, a lot of shaming <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28886101/135524916-a1b02174-2ba3-443f-8330-db07df67a9b4.jpg" width="20"> & gaming when collaborated with wise words <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28886101/135525026-3a07cd4b-8317-422f-be6d-dbafa3c5946d.jpeg" width="50"> from your tutor (in my case it was my elder sister Akanksha and my brother in law Shishir), I got highly motivated and concerned about my future that somehow after loads of rejections I got a job too. 

<sub>Happiest (>‿◠)✌ day of my life,  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28886101/135525318-c69418e5-1ced-4524-a29a-19ea527cb8e7.png" width="60"> it is! One of the top Fortune 500 Company.
Now It was my turn to show off on <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28886101/135524061-01516e19-5613-496a-8019-aaa8004ef510.png" width="10">acebook, may be this happiness was more concerned with showcasing it and not realizing that this job beholds my <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28886101/135525636-839a8fb1-4c23-4466-aed7-79c1633ef10f.png" width="50">.

<sub>I still remember leaving Jaipur<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28886101/135526562-730e6f0f-4cc9-4ac4-838a-343424137410.png" width="30"> (my home town) as I got Kolkata <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28886101/135526619-ca69fb9c-94d6-42da-bdc7-ed60f415c5ec.jpeg" width="50"> as my joining Location.

<sub>I joined as a trainee and post few months got permanent and being relocated to Pune <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28886101/135526685-264d0aa9-ea2e-4db2-b813-cd22e09b43d1.jpeg" width="50"> - the Dream City.
Worked in Cognizant aimlessly for 4 years, learnt nothing but <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28886101/135526736-0a583026-1a1d-44a6-88da-1e7b4784db96.png" width="70"> ,<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28886101/135526780-603109a0-1582-475f-ae5b-53b47836baee.png" width="60">.
May be because I was in Service Based Company? May be *YES* , May be *NO*? Or may be I have got no zeal to nourish my <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28886101/135525636-839a8fb1-4c23-4466-aed7-79c1633ef10f.png" width="50"> ?

<sub>Again my *sister* <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28886101/135527590-2bc7acbc-058d-4b25-9123-c5dd0602660f.jpg" width="20"> advised *me* <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28886101/135527628-fb01dcc4-642b-4995-acc7-fdfca11d1b24.jpg" width="30"> to study and switch to a better company and learn new things. By better company I meant Product Based Company and By learning new things I meant Operating System and Data Structures & Algorithms. 

<sub>I started but with less of focus as always. So I shifted my direction again and studied <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28886101/135527702-289e5e7b-9e36-4db7-9892-1669e1259d7a.gif" width="50"> & frameworks instead.
Got interviewed and got the job again. The only change was that this was a Product Based Company and a small one. Nothing like Cognizant. 
May be no one has heard the name as well.

<sub>I asked my *Sister* <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28886101/135527590-2bc7acbc-058d-4b25-9123-c5dd0602660f.jpg" width="20">, "Shall I join this company ? It is a small one and just started few years back" ?
She said "You have got no option, go try it. Learn something new ".
As someone like "*Me*" a really aimless, hopeless person would really go and learn 【 👁️︠ ෴ ︡👁️】? "I laughed on myself". 
<br>
When I joined, it was a small company, total of 50 employees, no cabins, no cross walls, just an open hall and  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28886101/135528332-e05870d7-d4bf-40fd-b3e5-d35b7466eef9.jpeg" width="100"> people were sitting across one another.
Have got a fridge there with food in it , a coffee machine and drawers full of <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28886101/135528601-df9acfab-4d40-41a2-bf18-7e9ea4b1a53d.png" width="20">  Maggi. I found my 🖤 there, went calm and made my peace with it.

<sub>I struggled initially because in here I really have to code. Have to create a request myself and design a Rest API.
I went nuts as I knew nothing but <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28886101/135526736-0a583026-1a1d-44a6-88da-1e7b4784db96.png" width="70"> ,<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28886101/135526780-603109a0-1582-475f-ae5b-53b47836baee.png" width="60">. 
<br>I studied, I googled and asked stupid questions but I learnt, and learnt a lot.
And finally, I designed an API and it worked end to end (✿◠‿◠) .

<sub>I learnt a new thing like my *sister* had told me.
Post that I learnt so many other things as well. I actually learnt ***coding*** and ***designing*** and ***making things from scratch***.
A small company taught me so well that It made me look big. Turned a ***USELESS*** person into a ***PRAGMATIST***.
Post 4 years in this company, I realized I still have no aim, I have got no zeal, no passion, no direction.

<sub>And then I remembered the golden words said by my *sister* "***Learn DSA and System Design***".
I had always wondered, why? ʕ•́ᴥ•̀ʔっ
Why do we need to study DSA?
How wide it is, vast course, infinite numbers of questions, lots of competitive sites like Leetcode, GeeksforGeeks and what not.

<sub>These things we get by ourselves only I believe, no one else can advise you or tell you to be a rich person untill you yourself wanted to be the one.
You learn things, when you in actuality crave for knowledge. ツ

<sub>And the kind of atmosphere in which you reside also matters a lot in this. The company and the kind of people we are surrounded by matters the most.
If you are surrounded by smart & geeky people, you will become smart or even try to be it otherwise you would not even try.

<sub>May be I got the right company or still remembered the golden words "DSA and System Design" that changed my life.
May be not fully but I can feel I am travelling on the correct path now (👍≖‿‿≖)👍 👍(≖‿‿≖👍) .

<sub>I wanted to be a productive person and started ***Learning DS***.
Started with easy questions, which seemed like Hard problems at first. 
Got demotivated and left it. ***Another Mistake***.

<sub>I heared things in my mind again few days later and started learning again. This time easy questions felt like medium level.
Medium were hard and still feels like.
Studided a book called ***Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle LaakMan*** which takes approxiately 20 days to finish but in may case it took 60 as I started from scratch.

<sub>Had completed around 120+ questions from GeeksforGeeks and finally thought to level up and start practicing Leetcode.
And here I realized <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28886101/135530305-e185804e-a85f-4eb0-a250-e2a59a56d17b.png" width="50">I made a mistake again. I started with GeeksforGeeks where in I should have started with Leetcode.
Because easy from GeeksforGeeks does not exist in Leetcode. Hard from GeeksforGeeks is Easy In Leetcode so I started again ⚤.

<sub>Here I learn then I forget then I learn again and it goes on and on.
It is kind of a never ending loop that circles forever.

<sub>I made mistakes and now I am rectifying those everyday without taking a leap so that when someone asks me ***Where do you see yourself ? , What do you want to become ?*** And I could say that ***I don't want to be that "Sharma Ji ka Ladka who got the job when I was sleeping" I want to become an <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28886101/135530958-1c282872-640a-48b6-9608-e44be28e8bb8.jpg" width="30"> ENTHUSIAST who can code like a girl <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28886101/135530942-e45bc905-afb2-40a9-bfeb-dab2462194e1.jpeg" width="50"> and can cook like a <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28886101/135531125-6a7868de-ae26-43cc-b57e-9542e915817f.jpg" width="30"> boy***. 

<sub>I *Made Mistakes* and I learnt from them.
